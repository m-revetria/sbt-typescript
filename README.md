# sbt-typescript 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joost-de-vries/sbt-typescript.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joost-de-vries/sbt-typescript)

This sbt plugin compiles the Typescript code in your Play application to javascript fit for consumption by your average browser and device.   

### Getting started
The easiest way to get started is to use the demo projects for [Angular2](https://github.com/joost-de-vries/play-angular2-typescript) or [React](https://github.com/joost-de-vries/play-reactjs-typescript). You can create the Angular2 application locally by running `sbt new joost-de-vries/play-angular-typescript.g8`. For the React application that's `sbt new joost-de-vries/play-reactjs-typescript.g8`  
   
### Configuring
Create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your project with the required [compiler options](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html). The following `tsc` compiler options are managed by `sbt-typescript` so setting them in `tsconfig.json` has no effect: `outDir`, `rootDirs`, `paths`, `baseUrl`, `typeRoots`.  
If you use the `stage` compile mode the `outFile` option is also managed by `sbt-typescript`.  
To be able to view the original Typescript code from your browser when developing add the following to `tsconfig.json`
```json
"compilerOptions": {
    "sourceMap": true,
    "mapRoot": "/assets",
    "sourceRoot": "/assets",
```

Add the following line to your `project\plugins.sbt`:

    addSbtPlugin("name.de-vries" % "sbt-typescript" % "2.7.0")

If your project is not a Play application you will have to enable `sbt-web` in `build.sbt`:

    lazy val root = (project in file(".")).enablePlugins(SbtWeb)
    
There are several Javascript engines you can use for the build. The fastest is NodeJs. So make sure you have a recent NodeJs installed and add to `build.sbt`

    JsEngineKeys.engineType := JsEngineKeys.EngineType.Node

NPM libraries are used as standard sbt dependencies (jar files). Add your typescript libraries as dependencies as follows. If the library doesn't include typescript definitions add them too.  
```scala
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("webjars","maven")
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
    "org.webjars.npm" % "react" % "15.4.0",
    "org.webjars.npm" % "types__react" % "15.0.34"
)
 ```
These NPM dependencies are resolved through [Webjars](http://webjars.org). Check whether the versions of the NPM packages you need are available there. If not you can add them yourself. Since we added the webjars resolver they'll be available immediately. Otherwise you'd have to wait a while before being able to use them. NB NPM package names like `@angular/code` and `@types/react` are a bit different in webjars: `angular__react` and `types__react`. 
Add the following to `build.sbt` to resolve against those npms.

    resolveFromWebjarsNodeModulesDir := true

To lint your Typescript code add [`sbt-tslint`](https://github.com/joost-de-vries/sbt-tslint) to your project and create a `tslint.json` file with the linting rules.

To test your Typescript code add an sbt plugin for a JS testframework. For instance [sbt-jasmine](https://github.com/joost-de-vries/sbt-jasmine) or [sbt-mocha](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-mocha). You can override `tsc` configurations for your test code. To do that create a file `tsconfig.test.json` and add to `build.sbt`

    (projectTestFile in typescript) := Some("tsconfig.test.json")

Any settings in that file will override those in `tsconfig.json` for the compilation of test code.

#### Configuring an IDE
The typescript version of your project can be found in `project/target/node-modules/webjars/typescript` Configure your IDE to use that and point it to the `tsconfig.json`.

#### Compiling directly through tsc
Sometimes it can be helpful to compile your project directly through the Typescript compiler without `sbt-typescript` in between to check whether a problem is an `sbt-typescript` problem. To do that you can run

    project/target/node-modules/webjars/typescript/bin/tsc -p . -w
Make sure to set the executable bit if necessary.
For this kind of compilation to work you have to fill in the settings in `tsconfig.json` that `sbt-typescript` normally manages. See the [Angular2 demo project](https://github.com/joost-de-vries/play-angular-typescript.g8/blob/master/src/main/g8/tsconfig.json) for an example.
    
#### Compiling to a single js file
You can develop using individual javascript files when running `sbt ~run` in Play and have your whole typescript application concatenated into a single javascript output file for your stage environment without changes to your sources. To do that you have to add a `-DtsCompileMode=stage` parameter to the sbt task in your CI that creates the stage app. So for Play that will often be `sbt stage -DtsCompileMode=stage`.  
    

#### import modules without type information
If you are importing modules for which you don't have the typings you can ignore the TS2307 `can not find module` error:

    tsCodesToIgnore := List(canNotFindModule)

## status
The plugin is young. Currently it is mostly tested against `EngineType.Node` and Angular2 applications with npm style dependencies.  
There are some other features I'm planning to implement.

## history
I started this plugin because the features I mentioned above were [missing](https://github.com/ArpNetworking/sbt-typescript/issues/1) in the [existing](https://github.com/ArpNetworking/sbt-typescript/issues/31) [plugins](https://github.com/ArpNetworking/sbt-typescript/issues/23#issuecomment-158099296).  
And since I'd like Play and sbt(-web) to be kickass build tools for Typescript and Angular2 applications, and I wanted to give back to the open source community, I thought I'd implement it myself.. But not by writing javascript if I could just as well write Typescript...   
Kudos to Brendan Arp for his [javascript tsc driver](https://github.com/ArpNetworking/sbt-typescript/blob/master/src/main/resources/typescriptc.js) to get me started. And also to all of the other plugins mentioned [here](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-web). Open source is an amazing tool for collective learning. Just imagine those poor programmers in the 1970s with only IBM manuals to provide them with information.
